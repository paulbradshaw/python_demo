# Jupyter (previously iPython) notebooks

Notebooks are a good way to embed working Python scripts within a narrative. For example, you might use them to explain the methodology behind a story, or as a more accessible way to commend code that you have used. [Here, for example, data journalist David Blood uses a Python notebook to explain how to use notebooks to find and analyse data](https://github.com/davidbjourno/finding-stories-in-data/blob/master/finding-stories-in-data.ipynb).

You can [find out more about installing Jupyter Notebooks on the Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install.html): the simplest way to get started is to use the online environment TryJupyter, but at some point you'll want to run it from your own computer, using Anaconda or command line as explained at that link. 

Jupyter notebooks use the `.ipynb` extension (this stands for iPython Notebook). 

You can use the advanced search in GitHub to find files that use this extension. [Here, for example, are ipynb files that use the words 'data' and 'journalism'](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=data+journalism+extension%3Aipynb&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)
