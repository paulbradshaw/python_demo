# Getting data out of Execute Python Online

You can save data as a CSV from Execute Python Online (EPO). Here's how:

## Create an empty CSV to hold the data

Click on **File > Create File**

A new file should appear on the left hand side, called `Newfile.py`. You need to rename it so that it knows it's a CSV file, so select **File > Rename File**.

Now the file name is editable. Call it `mydata.csv` or something similar (if you choose a different name make sure you use it in the code below too).
