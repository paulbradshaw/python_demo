    "\n",
    "One way is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once that's installed, run it, and then click on the **Launch** button for Jupyter notebook. This should open it in your browser at an address that starts with `http://localhost:8889/notebooks/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to use [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects). This is a web-based interface for creating notebooks: it's slower than Anaconda but you can get started with it without having to install anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing notebooks publicly\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created you can share your notebook using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, download your notebook from Jupyter by clicking on **File > Download as > Notebook (ipynb)**\n",
    "2. Create a repository on Github (or if you already have one for your project, go there) and upload that ipynb file. Copy the link to that file into\n",
    "3. Go to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the URL into the box on the homepage. You should now be given a link to the readable public version.\n",
