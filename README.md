# Some stuff to do in Python

Yep.

Start here: [A brief introduction to Execute Python Online](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/executepythononline.md). This introduces you to an online coding environment which allows you to play with the basics of using Python, but without having to set up an environment on your own computer.

[You might find Try Jupyter an easier option](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/tryjupyter.md) - a brief intro at that link.

[And playing with PythonAnywhere](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/pythonanywhere.md) can be useful too.

There's also [Trinket](https://trinket.io/), which could be a way to allow people to play with your code as you can embed both code and results in an iframe.

[The next step - storing data using Morph.io - can be found here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/morphio.md)

After that it's worth looking at [creating a web app on PythonAnywhere](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/WebAppBasics/)... Here's [one tutorial on creating a database-backed website using it](https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/121/) and [here's another](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/567/)

[Jupyter notebooks (previously iPython) are outlined here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks.md)
