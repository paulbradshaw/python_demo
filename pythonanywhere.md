# PythonAnywhere

[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) is another web platform for running Python (or IDE, in the jargon). You can create one 'console' for free, or pay for more. But the site also allows you to create a 'web app' if that's your thing.

Once logged in you should be taken to a page which has a URL like this:

`https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/YOURUSERNAME/consoles/`

Look at the tabs across the top: this is where you can create stuff:

* **Consoles** is where you create a Terminal-style environment for running lines of code, but it's not great for writing scripts
* **Files** is much more useful: you can create different Python scripts here, and then run them in a console which occupies the bottom of the screen
* **Web** is where you can create a web app. Cool. This will live at YOURUSERNAME.pythonanywhere.com if you have the free account, or you can pay to have a different domain
* **Schedule** allows you to schedule scripts (created in **Files**) to run at particular times. Also cool.
* **Databases** is where you can create a MySQL database. Useful to store info from scrapers? Or serve up information based on user queries? Cool again.

Note: when creating a console or file choose the version of Python you're most familiar with (my book, and most online resources, are in 2.7).

There's a [tutorial here from Hacks/Hackers DC](https://github.com/eads/hhdcpython) which gives you a bit of experience with Bash and cloning GitHub repos using command line.
