# PythonAnywhere

[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) is another web platform for running Python (or IDE, in the jargon). You can create one 'console' for free, or pay for more. But the site also allows you to create a 'web app' if that's your thing.

When creating a console choose the versio of Python you're most familiar with (my book, and most online resources, are in 2.7).

There's a [tutorial here from Hacks/Hackers DC](https://github.com/eads/hhdcpython) which uses that, and also gives you a bit of experience with Bash and cloning GitHub repos using command line.
